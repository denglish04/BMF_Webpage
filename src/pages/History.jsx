            <p> The Harvard Black Men’s Forum (BMF), originally founded in the 1970s, was revitalized in 1999 by a 
                group of undergraduates to create a safe space for black men on Harvard’s campus. Since then, BMF 
                has grown from a small-scale initiative of Harvard students to one of the most recognized and celebrated 
                organizations on Harvard’s campus. </p>
